## FAST-LIO
**FAST-LIO** (Fast LiDAR-Inertial Odometry) is a computationally efficient and robust LiDAR-inertial odometry package. It fuses LiDAR feature points with IMU data using a tightly-coupled iterated extended Kalman filter to allow robust navigation in fast-motion, noisy or cluttered environments where degeneration occurs. Our package address many key issues:
1. Fast iterated Kalman filter for odometry optimization;
2. Automaticaly initialized at most steady environments;
3. Parallel KD-Tree Search to decrease the computation;

## FAST-LIO 2.0 (2021-07-05 Update)

<img src="doc/overview_fastlio2.svg" width=99% />
</div>

**New Features:**
1. Incremental mapping using [ikd-Tree](https://github.com/hku-mars/ikd-Tree), achieve faster speed and over 100Hz LiDAR rate.
2. Direct odometry (scan to map) on Raw LiDAR points (feature extraction can be disabled), achieving better accuracy.
3. Since no requirements for feature extraction, FAST-LIO2 can support many types of LiDAR including spinning (Velodyne, Ouster) and solid-state (Livox Avia, Horizon, MID-70) LiDARs, and can be easily extended to support more LiDARs.
4. Support external IMU.
5. Support ARM-based platforms including Khadas VIM3, Nivida TX2, Raspberry Pi 4B(8G RAM).

## 1. Prerequisites
### 1.1 **Ubuntu** and **ROS**
**Ubuntu >= 20.04**

The **default from apt** PCL and Eigen is enough for FAST-LIO to work normally.

ROS >= Foxy (Recommend to use ROS-Humble). [ROS Installation](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html)

### 1.2. **PCL && Eigen**
PCL    >= 1.8,   Follow [PCL Installation](https://pointclouds.org/downloads/#linux).

Eigen  >= 3.3.4, Follow [Eigen Installation](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page).

### <span id="1.3">1.3. **livox_ros_driver2**</span>
Follow [livox_ros_driver2 Installation](https://github.com/Livox-SDK/livox_ros_driver2).

You can also use the one I modified [livox_ros_driver2](https://github.com/Ericsii/livox_ros_driver2/tree/feature/use-standard-unit)

*Remarks:*
- Since the FAST-LIO must support Livox serials LiDAR firstly, so the **livox_ros_driver** must be installed and **sourced** before run any FAST-LIO launch file.
- How to source? The easiest way is add the line ``` source $Licox_ros_driver_dir$/devel/setup.bash ``` to the end of file ``` ~/.bashrc ```, where ``` $Licox_ros_driver_dir$ ``` is the directory of the livox ros driver workspace (should be the ``` ws_livox ``` directory if you completely followed the livox official document).


## 2. Build
Clone the repository and colcon build:

```bash
    cd <ros2_ws>/src # cd into a ros2 workspace folder
    git clone https://github.com/Ericsii/FAST_LIO.git --recursive
    cd ..
    rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -y
    colcon build --symlink-install
    . ./install/setup.bash # use setup.zsh if use zsh
```
- **Remember to source the livox_ros_driver before build (follow [1.3 livox_ros_driver](#1.3))**
- If you want to use a custom build of PCL, add the following line to ~/.bashrc
```export PCL_ROOT={CUSTOM_PCL_PATH}```
## 3. Directly run
Noted:

A. Please make sure the IMU and LiDAR are **Synchronized**, that's important.

B. The warning message "Failed to find match for field 'time'." means the timestamps of each LiDAR points are missed in the rosbag file. That is important for the forward propagation and backwark propagation.

C. We recommend to set the **extrinsic_est_en** to false if the extrinsic is give. As for the extrinsic initiallization, please refer to our recent work: [**Robust Real-time LiDAR-inertial Initialization**](https://github.com/hku-mars/LiDAR_IMU_Init).

### 3.1 Run use ros launch
Connect to your PC to Livox LiDAR by following  [Livox-ros-driver2 installation](https://github.com/Livox-SDK/livox_ros_driver2), then
```bash
cd <ros2_ws>
. install/setup.bash # use setup.zsh if use zsh
ros2 launch fast_lio mapping.launch.py config_file:=avia.yaml
```

Change `config_file` parameter to other yaml file under config directory as you need.

Launch livox ros driver. Use MID360 as an example.

```bash
ros2 launch livox_ros_driver2 msg_MID360_launch.py
```

- For livox serials, FAST-LIO only support the data collected by the ``` livox_lidar_msg.launch ``` since only its ``` livox_ros_driver2/CustomMsg ``` data structure produces the timestamp of each LiDAR point which is very important for the motion undistortion. ``` livox_lidar.launch ``` can not produce it right now.
- If you want to change the frame rate, please modify the **publish_freq** parameter in the [livox_lidar_msg.launch](https://github.com/Livox-SDK/livox_ros_driver/blob/master/livox_ros_driver2/launch/livox_lidar_msg.launch) of [Livox-ros-driver](https://github.com/Livox-SDK/livox_ros_driver2) before make the livox_ros_driver pakage.

### 3.2 For Livox serials with external IMU

mapping_avia.launch theratically supports mid-70, mid-40 or other livox serial LiDAR, but need to setup some parameters befor run:

Edit ``` config/avia.yaml ``` to set the below parameters:

1. LiDAR point cloud topic name: ``` lid_topic ```
2. IMU topic name: ``` imu_topic ```
3. Translational extrinsic: ``` extrinsic_T ```
4. Rotational extrinsic: ``` extrinsic_R ``` (only support rotation matrix)
- The extrinsic parameters in FAST-LIO is defined as the LiDAR's pose (position and rotation matrix) in IMU body frame (i.e. the IMU is the base frame). They can be found in the official manual.
- FAST-LIO produces a very simple software time sync for livox LiDAR, set parameter ```time_sync_en``` to ture to turn on. But turn on **ONLY IF external time synchronization is really not possible**, since the software time sync cannot make sure accuracy.

### 3.4 PCD file save

Set ``` pcd_save_enable ``` in launchfile to ``` 1 ```. All the scans (in global frame) will be accumulated and saved to the file ``` FAST_LIO/PCD/scans.pcd ``` after the FAST-LIO is terminated. ```pcl_viewer scans.pcd``` can visualize the point clouds.

*Tips for pcl_viewer:*
- change what to visualize/color by pressing keyboard 1,2,3,4,5 when pcl_viewer is running. 
```
    1 is all random
    2 is X values
    3 is Y values
    4 is Z values
    5 is intensity
```

## 5.Implementation on UAV
In order to validate the robustness and computational efficiency of FAST-LIO in actual mobile robots, we build a small-scale quadrotor which can carry a Livox Avia LiDAR with 70 degree FoV and a DJI Manifold 2-C onboard computer with a 1.8 GHz Intel i7-8550U CPU and 8 G RAM, as shown in below.

The main structure of this UAV is 3d printed (Aluminum or PLA), the .stl file will be open-sourced in the future.

### EasyFly bounded scan backlog (2026-10-25)

The ROS LiDAR receive history and the pending processing queue each retain at
most two scans. If processing falls behind, a new scan replaces the oldest
unprocessed scan and cancels its pending synchronization selection. Cloud and
acquisition time share one queue entry, so dropping/resetting a cloud cannot
leave an old timestamp at the front. IMU samples already received remain in
the separate integration queue; the IMU DDS depth is 200 instead of 10 to
cover short processing stalls. Original source stamps, EKF/map operations and
UI/planning freshness limits are unchanged. This favors recent localization
over exhaustive processing of old scans and does not promise freshness under
unbounded CPU starvation or lossless sensor delivery.

A real sparse-scene discovery-pressure run retained fresh raw LiDAR but
produced FAST-LIO/TF data 7–9 seconds old. Evidence and before/after checks are
in `artifacts/b06-b14-20261025/`. The queue tests cover a waiting scan replaced
during a processing blackout and cloud/timestamp pairing after queue reset.

The path still keeps one historical point per ten observations, but its final
point is replaced by each latest real observation. Publication is limited to
5 Hz by steady time and occurs only when a new scan has been processed. Both
the path header and final pose retain that scan's source time. This avoids
waiting for ten slowly processed scans before publishing a fresh path; stopped
input still expires normally. The regression checks the latest tip and retained
historical density. The final real sparse-scene run with concurrent endpoint
churn kept all five layers visible in 198 samples on the same RViz instance.

### EasyFly native signal shutdown (2026-10-26)

Keep the SIGINT/SIGTERM handlers installed by `rclcpp::init`. ROS dispatches
shutdown from its dedicated signal thread; calling `rclcpp::shutdown()` or
iostream operations directly from a POSIX signal handler can deadlock when
the interrupted thread holds a lock needed by shutdown. The previous custom
SIGINT handler is removed; sensor timestamps and estimation are unchanged.

`test_signal_shutdown` starts the real native process with a test-only preload
library. It checks ordinary SIGINT/SIGTERM and SIGINT delivered while a worker
holds a mutex needed by a shutdown callback, with both wall time and a frozen
simulation clock. The probe is not installed. The captured old binary deadlocks
in the critical-section case; both current installations exit normally. The
first V-08 hour's specific interrupted lock was not captured, so this regression
does not identify that incident's exact lock. Full product lifecycle verification
is recorded separately under `artifacts/v01-v16-20261025/`.

### EasyFly local map publication

`/Laser_map` publishes a snapshot of the current native ikd-tree local map.
Repeated timer ticks replace the previous publication buffer; they no longer
append another copy of the latest scan. Spatial retention and downsampling
remain those of the estimator's existing local map. `/cloud_registered`, pose
estimation, calibration and source timestamps retain their existing behavior.

The snapshot uses the existing single foreground executor and excludes the
background tree rebuild, including reclamation of the old tree. A busy rebuild
defers that visualization publication instead of blocking localization. The
map-save service writes the most recent published local snapshot, so it omits
points already removed from the local map and duplicate historical scans. Use
an explicit sensor recording when lossless scan history is required.

The registered `test_map_snapshot` covers replacement of an empty result,
repeated snapshots without accumulation, and current point membership after
native deletion, insertion and asynchronous rebuilding. Validation evidence is
maintained separately in the V-08 run directory.
